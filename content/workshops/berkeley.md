### First Software Sustainability Institute Workshop in Berkeley, CA (April 10-12)

![](https://i.imgur.com/o8xjqVy.jpg)

In this workshop, we want to:

- Introduce URSSI
- Help attendees meet each other and understand their goals
- Pilot some initial survey questions, and gather inputs about where our survey should be distributed
- Talk about the idea of ethnographic studies, and gather ideas on specific people and projects to study
- Present a set of topics that we think will be potential areas of work in a future institute
- Identify a subset of these, plus additional topics that are potentially important to the community, to discuss further
- Refine, merge, discard topics
- Find who among the attendees might lead discussion on them
- Document the workshopâ€™s results

We want to come out of this workshop with:

- An informed and enthused set of attendees (including a group photo)
- An improved survey, and a set of survey distribution mechanism
- Potential ethnographic study subjects
- An initial list of candidate topics for an institute, some of which may be well-understood
- A set of topics that should be further discussed in smaller follow-on workshops
- Initial thoughts on institute roles - what could an institute do to address the topics?
- Initial thoughts on institute organization - how could an institute be organized to do this?
